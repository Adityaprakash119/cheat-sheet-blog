                    <h3>Lack of Clarity</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Perhaps you feel like the material you are learning is unnecessary. <br>It may even seem like busywork or a waste of time. <br>If you’re unclear of the purpose for why you should be learning something, you may feel like skipping over it entirely. </p>
                <p><b>Proposed Solution:</b>If something you’re learning feels unnecessary, don’t be afraid to ask your professor or teacher for more insight. Rather than approaching the situation in an angry manner, be sure to clearly explain why you’re asking the question you are and share that you want to understand how this material fits into the rest</p>

                    <h3> Lack of Time</h3>
                </a>
                <p>No matter how important material may actually be, you could simply feel out of time. From juggling work, school, family, and your social life, school is understandably overwhelming. If it feels like time is out of your control and cheating is your only option, first take a step back.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b><b>Proposed Solution: </b></b>  Being busy can be a genuine problem, but time management allows you to take control of how you spend your time. It could be that your schedule is so busy that online university is a better solution for your learning, as it offers more flexibility. Or, you may want to communicate with your boss that you have exams coming up and see how your work schedule could be adjusted.

                    <h3>Lack of Motivation</h3>
                </a>
                <p>It’s easy to want to do many other things instead of studying. While studying is not usually the first task of the day that a person wants to handle, it’s best to get it done when you work the best. If you’re better and more alert in the mornings, then knock it out then.</p>
                <br>

                <p><b>Proposed Solution:</b>One way to feel more motivated to study is to offer yourself rewards. If you gamify school, then you can stay on track through a positive reward system. Another idea is to take breaks. Taking breaks is important to avoid burnout, and then, instead of an hour straight of studying, you can try this: study with zero interaction for 25 minutes, then take a 15-minute break, and then study again for 25 minutes.</p>

                <p>It’s possible you actually do know the material well enough to get a good grade on a test — but you still feel fearful that you don’t. You may be tempted to write notes on a piece of paper and hide it during a test.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Proposed Solution:</b>Instead, you need to tell yourself you understand the work. If you’ve taken the time to study and genuinely done all you can, you will feel more confident. It all starts with the process and honing in the basics.</p>

                <p>Some students write their notes on their drink labels. Why doesn’t it work? A lot of tests have proctors or teachers who won’t let you have food or drinks during the test. Also, it will most probably scratch off or be noticeable when you’re reading your label during a test.</p>
